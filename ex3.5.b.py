# Consider the following tasks. For each task, provide the code for an inefficient 
# implementation and an efficient implementation. State the worst-case complexity 
# of each. Then, provide the code for an experiment that demonstrates the difference. 
# The experiment should: 
# (i) time the execution of both implementations on realistic, 
#     large inputs (1000 elements or above); (ii) plot the distribution of measured values 
#     across multiple measurements (>= 100 measurements per task)
# (iii) print an aggregate of the measured values (min or average as appropriate).

# Insertion in and extraction from priority queue
